# Testing Strategy for AI Assignment Feedback Platform

This document outlines the testing approach for the AI Assignment Feedback Platform.

## Testing Layers

Our testing strategy follows a pyramid approach with four main layers:

1. **Unit Tests**: Test individual functions, classes, and modules in isolation.
2. **Integration Tests**: Test interaction between components, especially API layers.
3. **Component Tests**: Test React components in isolation.
4. **End-to-End Tests**: Test complete user workflows and scenarios.

## Test Directory Structure

```
test/
├── unit/                  # Unit tests
│   ├── error-handler.test.ts    # Tests for error handling utilities
│   └── batch-operations.test.ts # Tests for batch operations service
├── integration/           # Integration tests
│   └── api-routes.test.ts       # Tests for API endpoints
├── components/            # Component tests
│   └── feedback-card.test.tsx   # Tests for UI components
├── e2e/                   # End-to-end tests
│   └── login-flow.test.ts       # Tests for complete user flows
├── mocks/                 # Mock data and handlers
│   ├── server.ts                # MSW server setup
│   └── handlers.ts              # MSW API mock handlers
├── setup.ts               # Global test setup
└── README.md              # Testing documentation
```

## Running Tests

We've provided a shell script to simplify test execution. To run tests:

```bash
# Run all tests
./test/run-tests.sh all

# Run specific test types
./test/run-tests.sh unit
./test/run-tests.sh integration
./test/run-tests.sh components
./test/run-tests.sh e2e

# Run tests with coverage
./test/run-tests.sh coverage

# Run tests in watch mode
./test/run-tests.sh watch
```

## Testing Tools

- **Vitest**: Testing framework for running tests
- **React Testing Library**: For testing React components
- **Mock Service Worker (MSW)**: For mocking API requests
- **Supertest**: For testing HTTP endpoints

## Testing Best Practices

1. **Test Isolation**: Each test should be independent and not rely on the state from previous tests.
2. **Mock External Dependencies**: Use mocks for external services, database, and APIs.
3. **Clear Naming**: Use descriptive test names that explain what is being tested.
4. **Arrange-Act-Assert Pattern**: Structure tests with setup, actions, and assertions clearly separated.
5. **Coverage Goals**: Aim for high coverage in core business logic and critical paths.

## Error Handling Testing

Our error handling tests verify that:

1. API errors return appropriate status codes and error messages
2. Client-side error boundaries catch and display errors properly
3. Form validation prevents invalid data submission
4. Edge cases are handled gracefully (empty responses, network errors)

## Continuous Integration

Tests are designed to run in CI environments with:

```bash
./test/run-tests.sh all
```

This ensures all PRs are tested before merging.
