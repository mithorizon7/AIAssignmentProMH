## Deployment Steps

### 1. Pre-Deployment Validation
```bash
# Run the production deployment script
./scripts/production-deploy.sh
```

### 2. Health Check Validation
```bash
# Check system health
curl http://localhost:5000/api/health

# Check detailed health
curl http://localhost:5000/api/health/detailed

# Check production readiness
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer <admin-token>" http://localhost:5000/api/admin/production-readiness
```

### 3. Performance Validation
- [ ] Response times < 500ms for critical endpoints
- [ ] Memory usage < 80% under normal load
- [ ] Database queries optimized
- [ ] Queue processing functional
- [ ] AI service responses stable

### 4. Security Validation
- [ ] Security monitoring active
- [ ] No critical vulnerabilities detected
- [ ] Rate limiting functional
- [ ] CSRF protection working
- [ ] Authentication flow secure

## Post-Deployment Monitoring

### Immediate Checks (First 15 minutes)
- [ ] Application starts without errors
- [ ] Health checks all passing
- [ ] Database connections stable
- [ ] Redis connections stable (if applicable)
- [ ] AI services responding
- [ ] Queue system operational

### Short-term Monitoring (First 2 hours)
- [ ] No memory leaks detected
- [ ] Response times stable
- [ ] Error rates < 1%
- [ ] Security alerts minimal
- [ ] User authentication working

### Long-term Monitoring (First 24 hours)
- [ ] System stability maintained
- [ ] Performance metrics stable
- [ ] Security monitoring effective
- [ ] Recovery system functional
- [ ] Backup processes working

## Rollback Plan

### If Issues Detected
1. **Immediate Response**
   - Stop the application
   - Check logs for error patterns
   - Verify database integrity

2. **Recovery Actions**
   - Use error recovery system
   - Restart failed services
   - Clear problematic queues

3. **Rollback Process**
   - Restore previous version
   - Reset database if necessary
   - Verify system stability

## Production Endpoints

### Health & Monitoring
- `GET /api/health` - Quick health check
- `GET /api/health/detailed` - Comprehensive health check
- `GET /api/admin/production-readiness` - Production readiness validation
- `GET /api/admin/database-health` - Database health check
- `GET /api/admin/queue-health` - Queue health check
- `GET /api/admin/security-health` - Security health check
- `GET /api/admin/recovery-status` - Recovery system status

### Admin Controls
- `POST /api/admin/trigger-recovery` - Manual recovery trigger
- `POST /api/admin/system-restart` - System restart (if implemented)

## Performance Benchmarks

### Expected Response Times
- Health check: < 100ms
- User authentication: < 200ms
- Assignment creation: < 500ms
- AI feedback generation: < 30s
- File upload: < 10s (per MB)

### Resource Usage Targets
- Memory usage: < 80%
- CPU usage: < 70%
- Database connections: < 80% of pool
- Queue processing: < 1000 jobs/hour

## Alert Thresholds

### Critical Alerts
- Application down for > 30 seconds
- Database connection failures
- Memory usage > 95%
- Error rate > 5%
- Security threats detected

### Warning Alerts
- Response time > 1 second
- Memory usage > 80%
- Queue backlog > 100 jobs
- Failed authentication attempts > 10/minute
