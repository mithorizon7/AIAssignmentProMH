- [ ] Add integration tests for submission flow
- [ ] Implement automated testing pipeline
- [ ] Add load testing framework

### 2. **Security Vulnerabilities**
**Status**: HIGH RISK - Production security gaps
**Impact**: Potential data breaches and unauthorized access
**Actions Required**:
- [ ] Remove all console.log statements from production code
- [ ] Implement proper session security validation
- [ ] Add comprehensive input sanitization
- [ ] Enable security headers enforcement
- [ ] Add API rate limiting protection

### 3. **Data Integrity Issues**
**Status**: CRITICAL - Database schema inconsistencies
**Impact**: Application crashes and data corruption
**Actions Required**:
- [ ] Fix database schema migration issues
- [ ] Implement proper data validation
- [ ] Add file upload security checks
- [ ] Create backup and recovery procedures
- [ ] Add data consistency validation

### 4. **Production Monitoring Gaps**
**Status**: HIGH - No production visibility
**Impact**: Cannot detect or resolve production issues
**Actions Required**:
- [ ] Implement comprehensive logging system
- [ ] Add performance monitoring
- [ ] Create alerting system for critical failures
- [ ] Add user activity tracking
- [ ] Implement health check endpoints

### 5. **Queue System Reliability**
**Status**: MEDIUM-HIGH - Queue not production-hardened
**Impact**: Assignment processing failures
**Actions Required**:
- [ ] Add queue failure recovery
- [ ] Implement dead letter queue handling
- [ ] Add queue performance monitoring
- [ ] Create queue backlog alerts
- [ ] Test queue under load
