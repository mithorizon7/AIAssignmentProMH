# Authentication and Submission Fixes

This document outlines the authentication and submission handling fixes implemented in the Academus platform.

## Authentication Fixes

### 1. Session Management Improvements
- Enhanced session configuration with proper security settings for both development and production environments
- Implemented session regeneration during login to prevent session fixation attacks
- Added explicit session destruction during logout to properly clean up resources
- Proper cookie configuration with secure and httpOnly flags in production

### 2. CSRF Token Generation
- Fixed CSRF token generation to use ES module-compatible crypto imports instead of require()
- Added fallback mechanisms for CSRF token generation when primary method fails
- Implemented better error handling and recovery for token generation failures
- Enhanced logging of CSRF-related errors for easier debugging

### 3. Authentication Error Handling
- Improved error messages for authentication failures with more specific guidance
- Added proper HTTP status codes (401 for unauthorized, 403 for forbidden)
- Enhanced user feedback for login, logout, and registration operations
- Implemented proper role-based access control validation

## Submission Handling Fixes

### 1. Database Error Resilience
- Fixed "mime_type" column error in submission queries by implementing fallback SQL approaches
- Added robust error handling for database operations with specific error recovery strategies
- Enhanced logging for database errors to facilitate debugging
- Created fallback mechanism to handle schema inconsistencies between code and database

### 2. Submission Flow Improvements
- Enhanced file upload validation and error handling
- Added better feedback for submission status changes
- Improved submission retrieval queries to be more resilient to schema changes
- Added comprehensive logging throughout the submission process

## Testing Implementation

### 1. Unit Tests
- **Session Management Tests**: Validate secure session configuration, authentication detection, and proper logout handling
- **CSRF Token Tests**: Confirm proper ESM-compatible CSRF token generation with fallbacks
- **Submission Error Handling Tests**: Verify database error resilience and recovery mechanisms

### 2. Integration Tests
- **Submission Resilience Tests**: End-to-end tests for submission flow with error simulation
- **Enhanced Authentication Flow Tests**: Comprehensive tests covering login, session maintenance, and logout

## Future Considerations

1. **Migration to Schema-Synchronized Database**: Consider implementing a migration system (e.g., Drizzle migrations) to ensure schema consistency
2. **Enhanced Error Monitoring**: Add centralized error tracking for better visibility into production issues
3. **Session Store Optimization**: Consider using Redis for session storage in production for better scalability
4. **Authentication Metrics**: Add monitoring for failed login attempts and other security-relevant events
