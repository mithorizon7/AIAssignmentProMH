# Security Improvements

## Authentication Requirements
- Modified both `/api/submissions` and `/api/anonymous-submissions` endpoints to require authentication
- Added client-side redirection to login for unauthenticated users via shareable links
- Implemented returnTo parameter to preserve navigation context after login
- Updated UI components to inform users about authentication requirements

## SQL Injection Protection
- Replaced direct string interpolation with parameterized queries in database fallback mechanisms
- Added security for the following methods in `storage.ts`:
  - `createSubmission`: Now uses parameterized query with proper parameter binding
  - `listSubmissionsForAssignment`: Now uses parameterized query with proper parameter binding
  - `getLatestSubmission`: Now uses parameterized query with proper parameter binding

## CSRF Protection Enhancements
- Removed insecure `Math.random()` fallback in CSRF token generation
- Increased token strength from 16 bytes to 32 bytes (64 hex characters)
- Modified development CSRF validation to properly check tokens
- Implemented "fail closed" approach for cryptography issues (returning 500 error rather than using insecure alternatives)
- Enhanced development environment token checks for better alignment with production behavior

## Testing
- Enhanced test scripts to verify authentication requirements
- Added SQL injection protection tests with malicious input patterns
- Created CSRF token security verification test
- Confirmed all security improvements are functioning correctly

## Future Considerations
- Address TypeScript errors in the `storage.ts` file related to Drizzle ORM API changes
- Consider implementing a more robust migration system to minimize the need for fallback queries
- Implement additional security headers using Helmet
- Add Content Security Policy (CSP) to restrict resource loading
- Consider implementing Subresource Integrity (SRI) for external scripts
