# Build Optimization Guide

This document outlines the build optimization strategies implemented in the AI-Powered Assignment Feedback Platform.

## Production Optimizations

When running in production mode (`NODE_ENV=production`), the following optimizations are automatically applied:

### Server-Side Optimizations

- **Compression**: HTTP response compression using `compression` middleware
- **Helmet**: Security headers for Express using `helmet`
- **Cache Control**: Proper cache headers for static assets
- **Error Handling**: Minimized error details in responses
- **Rate Limiting**: API rate limiting to prevent abuse
- **Logging**: Production-appropriate logging levels

### Client-Side Optimizations

- **Bundle Size**: Code splitting and tree shaking for minimal bundle size
- **Caching**: Content-hashed filenames for proper cache invalidation
- **Minification**: JavaScript and CSS minification
- **Image Optimization**: Automatic image optimization
- **CSS Optimization**: CSS purging to remove unused styles
- **Font Optimization**: Font display optimization and preloading
- **Code Splitting**: Component-level code splitting for faster initial load

## Development vs. Production Mode

The application uses different strategies in development vs. production:

| Feature | Development | Production |
|---------|-------------|------------|
| Error Stack Traces | Full stack traces | Minimized for security |
| Hot Module Replacement | Enabled | Disabled |
| Source Maps | Full source maps | External source maps |
| Cache Busting | Using URL parameters | Using content hashing |
| Bundling | Minimal bundling | Optimized bundling |
| Queue Processing | In-memory mock | Redis-backed queue |
| Database Logging | Verbose SQL logging | Minimal logging |

## Environment Variables

The following environment variables affect the build and optimization process:

- `NODE_ENV`: Set to 'production' to enable all production optimizations
- `VITE_ENABLE_DEVTOOLS`: Set to 'true' to enable development tools even in production (not recommended)
- `VITE_API_URL`: Override the API URL for the frontend (useful for deployments)

## Build Process

The application uses the following build process:

1. Server: Compiled using ESBuild for optimal performance
2. Client: Built using Vite with optimizations

To build the application for production:

```bash
npm run build
```

This will create optimized builds in the `dist` directory:
- `dist/client`: Static assets for the frontend
- `dist/server`: Compiled server code

## Serving the Application

In production, the application server handles both API requests and serving the frontend assets. No separate static file server is needed.

To start the production server:

```bash
npm start
```

## Performance Monitoring

In production, you can monitor the application's performance using:

- Server logs for backend performance metrics
- Client-side performance monitoring through the browser's performance API
- Redis monitoring for queue performance

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter performance issues in production:

1. Check server logs for slow API endpoints
2. Monitor Redis queue for bottlenecks
3. Review client network requests for slow resources
4. Consider scaling horizontally for high traffic
