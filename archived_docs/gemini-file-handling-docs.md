# Gemini Adapter File Handling Documentation

## Overview

This document describes the file handling improvements implemented in the Gemini adapter to ensure proper processing of all file types, with special focus on DOCX files.

## Key Improvements

### 1. DOCX File Handling

DOCX files are now properly processed using the Gemini Files API with the following fixes:

- Ensured `genAI` is correctly passed as the first parameter to `createFileData`
- Used the proper parameter format required by the Gemini SDK v0.14.0 
- Implemented the temporary file approach for reliable file uploads
- Fixed type casting patterns to use proper object creation instead of type casting

### 2. Variable Naming Consistency

- Renamed loop variables from `part` to `promptPart` to avoid conflicts with the API `Part` type
- Used descriptive variable names like `responsePart` for response handling
- Improved code readability and reduced confusion between different variable usages

### 3. Optimized File Type Handling

The system now intelligently chooses the appropriate approach for different file types:

- **DOCX and other document formats**: Always use Files API
- **SVG images**: Always use Files API regardless of size
- **Small images** (< 5MB): Use inline data URIs for optimal performance
- **Large images** (> 5MB): Use Files API
- **Audio and video**: Always use Files API

### 4. Code Cleanup

- Removed obsolete `toSDKFormat` function
- Removed unnecessary debug logs
- Improved error handling for file operations
- Added better type safety throughout the code

## Implementation Details

### File Upload Process

1. Content detection evaluates file type and size
2. Decision is made whether to use Files API or inline data
3. For Files API:
   - Content is saved to a temporary file
   - File is uploaded via Gemini Files API
   - Temporary file is cleaned up
   - File reference is returned
4. For inline data:
   - Content is converted to base64
   - Data URI is properly formatted for Gemini API

### Parameter Format for SDK v0.14.0

```javascript
// Correct format for Gemini SDK v0.14.0
const file = await genAI.files.upload({
  file: tempFilePath,
  config: { mimeType }
});
```

### File Part Structure

```javascript
// Properly typed file part
const filePart: Part = {
  fileData: {
    fileUri: fileData.fileUri,
    mimeType: fileData.mimeType
  }
};
```

## Testing

Two test scripts were created to validate the improvements:

1. `test-docx-handling-fixed.js`: Tests DOCX file uploads and processing
2. `test-image-handling-fixed.js`: Tests handling of various image types and sizes

## Notes for Future Development

- Continue monitoring Gemini SDK updates for any API changes
- The current implementation is compatible with Gemini SDK v0.14.x
- No immediate plans to migrate to Vertex AI
