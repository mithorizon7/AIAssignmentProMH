- ✅ **Enterprise Settings**: IPv4 family, reduced loading timeout

**Performance Benefits**:
- Reduced connection overhead with keep-alive optimization
- Faster command execution through auto-pipelining
- Better error handling with immediate feedback
- Optimized for Upstash Redis cloud service limits

### ✅ BullMQ Queue Performance Enhancements
**Configuration Optimizations**:
- ✅ **Dynamic Concurrency**: 3 workers (dev) → 10 workers (production)
- ✅ **Memory Optimization**: Reduced job retention (50 completed, 25 failed)
- ✅ **Timeout Management**: 5-minute job timeout with stall detection (30s)
- ✅ **Rate Limiting**: 100 jobs/minute to respect Upstash limits
- ✅ **Retry Strategy**: Exponential backoff with 2s initial delay
- ✅ **Worker Settings**: Enhanced stall detection and recovery

**Throughput Improvements**:
- 233% increase in worker concurrency (production)
- Optimized memory usage for Redis storage
- Intelligent rate limiting prevents Redis overload
- Faster job processing with reduced retry delays

## 📊 Queue Performance Monitoring System

### ✅ Comprehensive Performance Monitoring
**Real-time Metrics**:
- ✅ **Job Timing**: Wait time, processing time, total time tracking
- ✅ **Throughput Monitoring**: Jobs per minute with historical trends
- ✅ **Health Indicators**: Queue backlog, failure rates, worker status
- ✅ **Performance Alerts**: Automatic detection of performance degradation
- ✅ **Resource Monitoring**: Memory usage and system health integration

**Monitoring Features**:
- 30-second metric collection intervals
- Historical job timing data retention
- Performance health scoring (excellent/good/warning/critical)
- Automated bottleneck detection and alerts
- Enterprise-scale queue monitoring dashboard

### ✅ Performance Analytics and Alerts
**Alert Conditions**:
- High wait time: >30 seconds average
- High processing time: >2 minutes average  
- Low throughput: <1 job/min with queue backup
- High failure rate: >10% job failure rate
- Queue backup: >50 jobs waiting

**Health Scoring System**:
- **Excellent**: <5 jobs/min throughput, minimal wait times
- **Good**: Normal operation within expected ranges
- **Warning**: Performance degradation detected
- **Critical**: Severe bottlenecks requiring immediate attention

## 🛠️ API Endpoints for Queue Management

### ✅ Admin Queue Management APIs
**Endpoints Implemented**:
- ✅ `GET /api/admin/queue/stats` - Comprehensive queue statistics
- ✅ `GET /api/admin/queue/performance` - Detailed performance report
- ✅ `GET /api/admin/queue/timings` - Recent job timing data
- ✅ `POST /api/admin/queue/retry-failed` - Retry failed submissions

**Enhanced Statistics Include**:
- Basic queue counts (waiting, active, completed, failed, delayed)
- Performance metrics (wait time, processing time, throughput)
- Health indicators (queue backlog status, failure rate, active workers)
- Recommendations for performance optimization
