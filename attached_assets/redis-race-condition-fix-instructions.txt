This is a tricky bug, but the logs provide a clear picture of what's going wrong. This is a race condition in your application's startup code.

What is the Problem?

Your application is connecting to Redis successfully, but the production readiness check is running too fast.

Here's the sequence of events happening, based on your logs:

Your application starts.

The Redis client begins connecting in the background (this is an asynchronous process).

Almost immediately, your "Production Validator" script runs to check if everything is ready.

The validator checks the Redis client's status. Since the client hasn't finished connecting yet, its status is "connecting," not "ready."

The validator sees the "connecting" status, incorrectly assumes Redis has failed, and crashes the application with the error: Redis client not ready for connections.

A few seconds after the crash, the Redis client successfully connects and reports "Redis client ready for commands", but it's too lateâ€”the application has already been terminated.

This is why you see a successful connection message right before the application enters the crash loop. The check is simply happening too early.

How to Fix It

The solution is to make the production validator wait for the Redis client to be ready before checking its status. This will resolve the race condition.

Here are clear directions for your developer.

Subject: Fix for Production Validator Race Condition (Redis Check)
Hi [Developer Name],

We've identified a race condition in the production startup validation that's causing the deployment to fail. The Redis health check is running before the client has had time to connect, resulting in a false negative that crashes the app.

We need to modify the production validator to wait for the Redis client to be fully ready before proceeding.

1. The Problem File

The issue is located in the file that performs the production readiness checks, likely named server/lib/production-validator.ts or similar.

2. The Solution

Please update the Redis check function to be asynchronous and to wait for the client's "ready" event before checking its status.

Current (Incorrect) Logic (example):

TypeScript
// This is synchronous and runs too early
function checkRedisStatus() {
  if (redisClient.status !== 'ready') {
    throw new Error('Redis client not ready');
  }
}
New (Correct) Logic:

Please implement a new function that returns a Promise. This promise should resolve only when the Redis client either connects successfully or fails definitively.

TypeScript
// In your redis-client.ts file, add this utility function
import { redisClient } from './redis-client';

export function waitForRedisReady(timeout = 5000): Promise<void> {
  return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    // If already ready, resolve immediately
    if (redisClient.status === 'ready') {
      return resolve();
    }

    const readyHandler = () => {
      clearTimeout(timer);
      redisClient.removeListener('error', errorHandler);
      resolve();
    };

    const errorHandler = (err: Error) => {
      clearTimeout(timer);
      redisClient.removeListener('ready', readyHandler);
      reject(new Error(`Redis connection failed: ${err.message}`));
    };

    const timer = setTimeout(() => {
      redisClient.removeListener('ready', readyHandler);
      redisClient.removeListener('error', errorHandler);
      reject(new Error('Redis connection timed out'));
    }, timeout);

    redisClient.once('ready', readyHandler);
    redisClient.once('error', errorHandler);
  });
}
Then, update your production validator to use this new asynchronous function.

TypeScript
// In your production-validator.ts file
import { waitForRedisReady } from '../queue/redis-client'; // Adjust path as needed

// ... inside your main validation function
try {
  await waitForRedisReady();
  logger.info('Redis connection is ready.');
  // Now you can proceed with other checks
} catch (error) {
  logger.error('Production readiness validation failed: Redis check failed.', { error: error.message });
  process.exit(1);
}
This change will force the validator to pause and wait for a definitive connection status from Redis, completely eliminating the race condition and allowing the application to deploy successfully.
