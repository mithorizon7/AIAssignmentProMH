Look this over as suggestions and take any actions that you think would be helpful. If it's already taken care of, that's ok. 
That's an excellent diagnosis from your developer, and they've correctly identified the type of problem, but it appears to be on a different route.

The issue of conflicting CSRF protection rules does exist, but it's on the **`/api/anonymous-submissions`** endpoint, not the `/api/submissions` endpoint.

### **Analysis of the Routes**

Your developer is correct that a route was being skipped by the global CSRF middleware while also having a conflicting local CSRF middleware applied. However, a review of the code shows which route was affected.

  * **`/api/submissions` (Authenticated Route)**
    This route is working correctly. The global configuration in `auth-2.ts` is set to skip CSRF protection for this path. The route's definition in `routes-4.ts` correctly omits the `csrfProtection` middleware, so there is no conflict.

    ```typescript
    // This route is configured correctly (No local csrfProtection)
    app.post('/api/submissions', requireAuth, upload.single('file'), asyncHandler(async (req: Request, res: Response) => {
      // ...
    }));
    ```

    \<br\>

  * **`/api/anonymous-submissions` (Anonymous Route) ðŸ‘ˆ This is the problem**
    This is where the conflict exists. This path is also on the global skip list in `auth-2.ts`. However, the route definition in `routes-4.ts` *incorrectly* includes the `csrfProtection` middleware, creating the conflict that causes the error.

    ```typescript
    // This route is configured INCORRECTLY
    app.post('/api/anonymous-submissions', submissionRateLimiter, csrfProtection, upload.single('file'), asyncHandler(async (req: Request, res: Response) => {
      // ...
    }));
    ```

In short, your developer's logic was sound, but the issue was with the anonymous submission route. The fix they describedâ€”removing the individual route protectionâ€”is the right solution, but it needs to be applied to `/api/anonymous-submissions`.
