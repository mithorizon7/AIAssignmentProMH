Let's update and improve the readme file. The README.md in the project root must be the starting point for anyone interacting with the repository. Don't change the replit.md file, because that is useful for you, so keep using it as you are supposed to. We are going to change documentation (and copy some from the replit file) to make better documentation for human developers. 

Step 2: Rebuild the README.md

Migrate the essential, long-lasting information from replit.md into your main README.md. It should contain:

Overview: The "Overview" section from replit.md.

Technology Stack: The "Technology Stack" section from replit.md.

Getting Started: A clear, concise guide for new developers, including:

Prerequisites

Cloning the repository

Installation (npm install)

Configuration (how to create and use the .env file).

How to Run: Instructions for running the app in development and production.

Link to Further Docs: A brief section that links to the docs/ directory for more detailed architectural guides and to the new CHANGELOG.md.

Step 3: Create a CHANGELOG.md

Create a new file in the root directory named CHANGELOG.md.

Copy all of the reverse-chronological "Recent Changes" sections from replit.md into this new file. This preserves the valuable history of bug fixes and feature enhancements in a standard location.

Step 4: Consolidate Architecture Docs

Your README.md already points to a structured documentation system. You should formalize this.

Copy the detailed "System Architecture," "Key Components," and "Data Flow" sections from replit.md into the existing docs/ folder.

The main README.md will then link to these deeper-dive documents, keeping the entry point clean and focused.

Consolidate Completion Reports: The various reports on completed tasks should be merged into a single changelog or moved to an archive folder.

Develop User-Facing Docs: Create separate documentation aimed at end-users, distinct from the technical implementation details.

Organize by Audience: Structure the documentation based on the target audience, such as developers, administrators, and end-users.
