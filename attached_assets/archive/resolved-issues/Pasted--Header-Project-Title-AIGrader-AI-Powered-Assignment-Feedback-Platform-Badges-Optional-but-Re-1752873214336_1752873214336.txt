Project Title: AIGrader - AI-Powered Assignment Feedback Platform.

Badges (Optional but Recommended): Include badges for build status, code coverage, license, etc., for a professional look.

One-Liner: A clear, concise sentence that summarizes what the project does.

Overview

A short paragraph explaining what the AIGrader platform is, the problem it solves, and who it's for. This should be migrated from the "Overview" section of replit.md.

Screenshot / Live Demo

Include a high-quality screenshot or an animated GIF of the application in action. This is the fastest way for someone to understand the user experience.

If there is a live version of the site, provide a prominent link to it.

Key Features

A bulleted list highlighting the main functionalities of the platform. Examples include:

AI-driven feedback using Google Gemini

Support for multiple submission types (text, images, documents)

Automated assignment status management

Role-based access for students, instructors, and admins

Technology Stack

Migrate the list of technologies from the "System Architecture" section of replit.md. List the major frameworks, languages, and services used (e.g., React, Express, PostgreSQL, Redis, etc.).

Getting Started (For Developers)

This is the most critical section for developer onboarding. It must be clear and tested.

Prerequisites: List all the software a developer needs to have installed on their machine before they can begin (e.g., Node.js, npm, PostgreSQL).

Installation: Provide the exact, copy-pasteable commands to clone the repository and install dependencies (git clone..., npm install).

Configuration:

Explain that the app requires an .env file for environment variables.

Instruct the user to copy the .env.example file to .env.

Provide a table explaining each environment variable, what it does, and if it's required for local development.

Usage

Provide the command(s) to start the local development server (e.g., npm run dev).

Explain what will happen after they run the command (e.g., "The application will be available at http://localhost:5000").

Contributing & License

Briefly explain how others can contribute to the project.

State the software license under which the project is released.

## Quality Standards

Clarity: Use simple, direct language.

Accuracy: Every command and instruction must be tested and correct.

Visuals: Use markdown formatting effectively to create a clean, readable layout.

Please consolidate all of this into a single, new README.md file and submit it as a pull request. This will replace the current file.
