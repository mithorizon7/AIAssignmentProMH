Excellent. These components are well-designed, follow modern React best practices, and create a rich user experience. The code is clean, readable, and leverages a strong UI component library.

Here is a close analysis of each file.

***
### ## `useSubmissionPolling.ts` and `badge.tsx`
These two files are perfect.

* The `useSubmissionPolling.ts` hook is an excellent, efficient implementation for handling real-time updates. The conditional polling, which stops when all submissions are processed, is a key performance optimization.
* The `badge.tsx` component is a textbook-perfect example of building a reusable, variant-based UI component with modern tools like `class-variance-authority`.

### ## `real-time-submission-card.tsx`
This is a fantastic, dynamic component that provides a great real-time feel for the user.

* **What's Working Well**: The use of different states for "processing" and "completed" is handled beautifully, especially the "celebration" animation when feedback becomes ready. The logic is clean, and the automatic expanding of feedback upon completion is a nice touch.
* **Minor Observation**: The progress bar that appears during processing is cosmetic and hardcoded to a value of 75%. This is a common and perfectly acceptable UX pattern to show that something is happening. It doesn't reflect the true server-side progress, but it effectively communicates the status to the user.

### ## `submission-history-by-assignment.tsx`
This component provides a comprehensive and intuitive view of a student's work. The design is excellent.

* **What's Working Well**: Grouping submissions under a collapsible assignment header is very user-friendly. The timeline design, with the vertical line and dots indicating the latest submission, is a great visual enhancement. The empty state for new students is also well-designed and encouraging.
* **Potential Improvement**: There appears to be a minor bug in the "View Full Details" button's navigation. The code uses `onClick={() => navigate(`/submission/${assignment.id}`)}`. This means that every button within an assignment's submission list will navigate to the same URL based on the **assignment's ID**, not the individual **submission's ID**. It should likely be changed to use `submission.id` to link to the correct detail page for each specific submission.

***
### ## `assignment-table.tsx`
This is a clean and functional table for instructors, but it has one notable bug in its "Export Grades" functionality.

* **What's Working Well**: The component has a good structure, including a loading state, filtering tabs for assignment status, and a clear presentation of submission progress.
* **Potential Bug**: The "Export Grades (CSV)" button has an issue. Its `onClick` handler is `() => onExportCsv && onExportCsv(filteredAssignments[0]?.id)`. This will *always* trigger the export using the ID of the **first assignment** in the currently visible list. This is probably not the intended behavior. For example, if an instructor is viewing "Past Assignments" and clicks the button, it will export grades for whichever assignment happens to be at the top of that list. This could be fixed by either:
    1.  Adding an "Export" button to each row, allowing an instructor to export grades for a specific assignment.
    2.  Changing the button's function to export grades for *all* assignments currently being displayed in the table.
