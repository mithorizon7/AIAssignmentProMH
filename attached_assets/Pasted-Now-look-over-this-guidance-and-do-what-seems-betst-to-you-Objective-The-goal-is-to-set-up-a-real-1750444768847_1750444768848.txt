Now look over this guidance and do what seems betst to you: 
Objective

The goal is to set up a real Redis instance for the development environment. According to the project's documentation, this will accomplish two main things:

Enable the Asynchronous Job Queue: The application uses BullMQ with Redis for handling large volumes of submissions and other background tasks. Enabling Redis will allow you to test this critical production feature.
Activate Production-like Session Management: The app uses Redis for session storage. Using a real Redis instance makes the development environment behave more like the production setup.
This will also eliminate the "mock Redis" warnings you see in the logs during startup.

High-Level Directions for Your Developer

Here are the steps to get the Redis instance configured and running with the application:

Provision a New Redis Instance

The first step is to create a Redis database. The easiest way to do this in your cloned Replit environment is to use the Tools panel on the left sidebar and add a Redis instance.
Alternatively, you can use any external cloud Redis provider (like Redis Labs, Upstash, etc.) and get its connection string.
Set the Environment Secrets

Once the Redis instance is created, you will get a connection URL. This URL needs to be added to the application's environment secrets.
REDIS_URL: Set this secret to the full connection URL provided by your Redis instance.
ENABLE_REDIS: Set this secret to true. As noted in the README.md and server/queue/redis.ts, this variable is required to force the application to use a real Redis connection in a development environment.
Restart and Verify

Stop and restart the application for the new environment variables to take effect.
Upon restarting, check the server logs. You should now see a confirmation message like "Connected to Redis server successfully" instead of the previous warnings about using a mock implementation. This will confirm that the application is correctly connected to your new Redis instance.Objective
