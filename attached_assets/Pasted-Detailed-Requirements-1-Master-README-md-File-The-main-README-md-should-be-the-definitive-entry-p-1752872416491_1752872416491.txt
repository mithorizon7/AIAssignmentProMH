Detailed Requirements

1. Master README.md File

The main README.md should be the definitive entry point for the project. Please ensure it is clear, concise, and contains the following sections:

Project Overview: A brief description of what the application does.

Features: A bulleted list of the main features.

Tech Stack: A list of the key technologies used (Node.js, Express, Vite, React, Redis, BullMQ, etc.).

Getting Started:

Prerequisites: What needs to be installed on a local machine (e.g., Node.js, npm).

Installation: Step-by-step instructions (git clone, npm install).

Configuration: Instructions on how to create a .env file from the .env.example and a detailed explanation of every environment variable.

Running the Application:

Development Mode: How to start the local development server.

Production Mode: How to build and run the application for production.

Scripts: An explanation of key package.json scripts (build, start, dev).

Testing: Instructions on how to run any tests.

2. Environment Configuration

Create or update an .env.example file in the root of the repository.

This file should list all required and optional environment variables.

For each variable, add a comment explaining what it's for, whether it's required, and an example of the expected value (e.g., BASE_URL="http://localhost:5000").

3. Inline Code Documentation

Review all major files and functions, especially in the server/ directory.

Ensure that all functions, classes, types, and complex logic have clear TSDoc comments explaining their purpose, parameters, and return values.

The documentation in server/queue/redis-client.ts is a good example of the standard we're aiming for. Please apply this level of detail to other critical parts of the application, like services, controllers, and middleware.

Focus on the "why" behind the code, not just the "what."

4. API Documentation

If not already present, create a dedicated API_DOCUMENTATION.md file or set up a Swagger/OpenAPI specification.

Document every API endpoint, including:

The HTTP method and URL path.

A description of what the endpoint does.

Required request headers, parameters, and body payloads (with examples).

Possible response status codes and response bodies (with examples).

5. Deployment Guide

Create a DEPLOYMENT.md file.

Provide a step-by-step guide for deploying the application to a production environment.

Crucially, this guide must include instructions on how to configure the production environment variables on the hosting platform, using the BASE_URL and STRUCTURED_LOGGING variables as the primary examples.

## Quality Standards

Clarity: Write in clear, simple language. Avoid jargon where possible.

Accuracy: Ensure all instructions, commands, and code examples are tested and work correctly.

Completeness: The documentation should leave no questions for a new developer trying to set up the project.

Consistency: Use consistent formatting (like Markdown) throughout all documentation files.
