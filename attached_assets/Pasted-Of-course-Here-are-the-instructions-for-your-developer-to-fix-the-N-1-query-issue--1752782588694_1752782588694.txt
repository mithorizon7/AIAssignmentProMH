Of course. Here are the instructions for your developer to fix the N+1 query issue.

-----

### \#\# The Change: Combine Two Database Queries into One

The goal is to refactor the `GET /assignments/:id/submissions` endpoint in the `instructor-2.ts` file.

Currently, this endpoint makes two separate queries to the database:

1.  First, it fetches all submissions for an assignment.
2.  Then, it collects the IDs from those submissions and makes a second query to fetch the feedback.

The change is to combine these into a **single, more efficient database query** that retrieves both the submissions and their associated feedback at the same time.

### \#\# The Reason: Performance at Scale

This change is critical for ensuring the application can handle the load from millions of students.

  * **Network Latency**: The current two-query approach creates unnecessary back-and-forth communication between your application server and the database. While this delay might be small with a few records, it becomes a major performance bottleneck under heavy load, leading to slow API responses.
  * **Database Efficiency**: Relational databases are highly optimized to perform `JOIN` operations. A single query with a `JOIN` allows the database's query planner to create the most efficient plan for retrieving the combined data, which is always faster than two separate, uncoordinated queries.
  * **Application Simplicity**: A single query simplifies the application code. It removes the need to manually build a list of IDs in memory and then map the results of the second query back to the first.

### \#\# How to Implement the Fix

In the `server/routes/instructor-2.ts` file, you will replace the existing database query logic inside the `GET /assignments/:id/submissions` route handler.

#### **Current Inefficient Code**

```typescript
// instructor-2.ts

// ...
// Get all submissions for the assignment with feedback
const submissionsData = await db
  .select({
    submission: submissions,
    userName: users.name,
    userEmail: users.email
  })
  .from(submissions)
  .innerJoin(users, eq(submissions.userId, users.id))
  .where(eq(submissions.assignmentId, assignmentId))
  .orderBy(desc(submissions.createdAt));

// Get submission IDs for feedback lookup
const submissionIds = submissionsData.map((s) => s.submission.id);

// Get feedback for all submissions
const feedbackItems = submissionIds.length > 0 
  ? await db
      .select()
      .from(feedback)
      .where(inArray(feedback.submissionId, submissionIds))
  : [];

const feedbackMap = new Map();
for (const item of feedbackItems) {
  feedbackMap.set(item.submissionId, item);
}
// ... manual mapping logic continues
```

#### **Recommended Fix**

Replace the block above with the following code. This version uses a single query with a `LEFT JOIN` to fetch all the data at once.

```typescript
// instructor-2.ts

// ...
// Get all submissions for the assignment with feedback using a single query
const submissionsWithFeedback = await db
  .select()
  .from(submissions)
  .innerJoin(users, eq(submissions.userId, users.id))
  .leftJoin(feedback, eq(submissions.id, feedback.submissionId)) // Use a LEFT JOIN here
  .where(eq(submissions.assignmentId, assignmentId))
  .orderBy(desc(submissions.createdAt));

// Get assignment metrics
const metrics = await metricsService.getAssignmentMetrics(assignmentId);

// Structure the final response
const result = submissionsWithFeedback.map(row => ({
  ...row.submissions, // Spread all properties from the submission
  student: {
    name: row.users.name,
    email: row.users.email
  },
  feedback: row.feedback || null // The feedback object will be present or null
}));

res.json({
  assignment,
  submissions: result,
  metrics: metrics[0] || null
});
// ...
```
